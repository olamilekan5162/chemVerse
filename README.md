# 🌐 ChemVerse || Universe of Chemistry

ChemVerse is a modern, interactive web application designed to simplify and gamify access to chemistry-related data. From exploring the periodic table to searching for compounds and drugs, ChemVerse leverages powerful public APIs to provide real-time, educational, and fun chemistry insights.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

ChemVerse integrates multiple public APIs like [PubChem PUG REST](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-rest), [OpenFDA](https://open.fda.gov/apis/) and [RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/mukundKumar/api/periodictable) to deliver rich chemistry data and drug data. Users can:

- 🔍 **Search for elements and compounds** by name and get details such as IUPAC name, molecular mass, molecular weight, structure etc.
- 📘 **Explore the periodic table** visually, and click on any element to view its full properties.
- 💊 **Discover drugs** using the OpenFDA database with RxCUI data, purpose, usage indications etc.
- 🧠 **Test their knowledge** through interactive quizzes with multiple-choice questions and explanations, making learning chemistry engaging and insightful.

The app is built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a sleek, responsive, and smooth user experience.
