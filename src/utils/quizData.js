    question: "Which element has the highest electronegativity?",
    options: ["Oxygen", "Fluorine", "Chlorine", "Nitrogen"],
    correctAnswer: "Fluorine",
    explanation:
      "Fluorine has the highest electronegativity (3.98 on the Pauling scale) due to its small atomic radius and high effective nuclear charge, which enables it to strongly attract electrons in a chemical bond.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the atomic number of Carbon?",
    options: ["4", "6", "12", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "The atomic number of an element equals the number of protons in its nucleus. Carbon has 6 protons, which defines its atomic number as 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which noble gas glows red-orange in neon signs?",
    options: ["Helium", "Argon", "Neon", "Xenon"],
    correctAnswer: "Neon",
    explanation:
      "Neon gas emits a red-orange glow when electrically excited, making it ideal for signs. This glow is due to electrons returning to lower energy levels after excitation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these elements is a liquid at room temperature?",
    options: ["Mercury", "Bromine", "Gallium", "Both A and B"],
    correctAnswer: "Both A and B",
    explanation:
      "Mercury and bromine are the only elements that exist as liquids at room temperature (25°C). Mercury is a metal, and bromine is a halogen.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the lightest element in the universe?",
    options: ["Helium", "Oxygen", "Hydrogen", "Lithium"],
    correctAnswer: "Hydrogen",
    explanation:
      "Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe. It has one proton and no neutrons in its most common isotope.",
  },
  // {
  //   question: "Which of these is NOT a real element symbol?",
  //   options: ["Uuq", "Xy", "Lv", "Bh"],
  //   correctAnswer: "Xy",
  //   explanation:
  //     "‘Xy’ is not an official chemical symbol. Uuq (now Fl), Lv (Livermorium), and Bh (Bohrium) are all valid IUPAC symbols for elements.",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: "What causes the shape of a molecule?",
  //   options: [
  //     "The color of atoms",
  //     "Electron pair repulsion",
  //     "The number of neutrons",
  //     "Gravitational forces",
  //   ],
  //   correctAnswer: "Electron pair repulsion",
  //   explanation:
  //     "Molecular shapes are determined by electron pair repulsion, explained by the VSEPR theory. Electron pairs around a central atom repel each other and orient themselves to minimize repulsion.",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: "What is the most reactive group of nonmetals?",
  //   options: ["Noble Gases", "Halogens", "Alkali Metals", "Lanthanides"],
  //   correctAnswer: "Halogens",
  //   explanation:
  //     "Halogens are highly reactive nonmetals due to their high electronegativity and tendency to gain one electron to complete their valence shell.",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: "What’s the defining feature of isotopes?",
  //   options: [
  //     "Same protons, different neutrons",
  //     "Different protons, same neutrons",
  //     "Different electrons",
  //     "Same number of all particles",
  //   ],
  //   correctAnswer: "Same protons, different neutrons",
  //   explanation:
  //     "Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons, resulting in different atomic masses.",
  // },
  // {
  //   question: "Which element is commonly used as fuel in nuclear reactors?",
  //   options: ["Uranium", "Cobalt", "Iron", "Silver"],
  //   correctAnswer: "Uranium",
  //   explanation:
  //     "Uranium, specifically uranium-235, is used in nuclear reactors because it undergoes fission, releasing a large amount of energy.",
  // },
