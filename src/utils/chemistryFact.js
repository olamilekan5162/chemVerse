    fact: "Water is a polar molecule, meaning it has a slightly positive charge on one end (hydrogen atoms) and a slightly negative charge on the other end (oxygen atom), which allows it to form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules.",
  },
  {
    fact: "The atomic number of an element is the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom, and it determines the element's position in the periodic table.",
  },
  {
    fact: "Chemical reactions involve the transformation of one or more substances into new substances, often accompanied by changes in energy, color, or odor.",

  {
    fact: "The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, only transformed from one substance to another.",

  {
    fact: "Acids are substances that donate a proton (H+ ion) or accept an electron pair, while bases are substances that accept a proton or donate an electron pair.",

    fact: "The pH scale is used to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution, with a pH of 7 being neutral, below 7 being acidic, and above 7 being basic.",

  {
    fact: "Chemical bonds are attractive and repulsive forces between atoms that hold them together in molecules, and can be classified into different types such as ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds.",
